# Wang Lab Database Connection Options

This repository offers two options for connecting to the Wang Lab Database: using R or Python. Below are instructions for each option:

## Option 1: Connecting with R

### Using R_Wang-Lab_dbcon.Rmd

1. Open the `R_Wang-Lab_dbcon.Rmd` file in RStudio or any other R Markdown editor.
2. Replace the placeholder values for database credentials with your actual database credentials.
3. Run the R code chunks sequentially to establish the connection, list tables in the database, query data, and display the results.

## Option 2: Connecting with Python

### Using Python_Wang-Lab_dbcon.ipynb

1. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Open the `R_Wang-Lab_dbcon.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Replace the placeholder values for database credentials with your actual database credentials.
4. Place the `functions.py` file in the same directory as the notebook file.
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to import libraries, establish the connection, query data, and display the results.

### Note

- For Python, ensure that the `functions.py` file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook to access the custom functions for database operations.
- Both options provide flexibility in querying the database and analyzing the fetched data.
